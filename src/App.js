          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer looking to keep learning in my field. I've
            always loved programatic thinking and realized in high school when I
            took a course in Assembly coding language that software development
            was a career that could allow me to spend my days solving complex
            problems and challenging myself to be better. Each day I work on
            self improvement and my ultimate goal is to watch myself change for
            the better. In my hobbies I feel this change in my physical
            abilities at the gym, and as a software engineer I see it in my
            ability to learn new languages and debug faster while creating more
            complex projects.
